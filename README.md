# Ecommerce Backend

## Description
This project is Express and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySql database that contains information for an e-commerce site. It creates an easier way to traverse through all the different categories,tags and products.

## Installation
Initially we run an npm i in order to install all necessary software.We then run the schema file through MySql in order to create a database. After we have a database created we can run the seed files that are located in the seeds folder. Once everything is setup we can start the server and go over to insomnia to check that everything is working as it should be.

## Usage
This project can be used to check throughout multiple levels of an e-commerce site in order to check on stats and either add or change the information.
